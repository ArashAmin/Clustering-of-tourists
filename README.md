For this purpose, the collection of data and their automatic analysis with high accuracy is of significant importance. In this exercise, the dataset pertains to 73 customers who have visited a hotel. Their ages range from 24 to 81 years, and they have all filled out a pre-designed questionnaire. Some of them have previously visited this hotel (38 people), while others are new customers (35 people). The dataset includes 22 variables, and the objective of the problem is to identify the type of customer.**
